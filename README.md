Source code for my program SCounter

(This project didn't use Git when I was working on it.)
This project is and will be "local-only", because I am the only person who works on it.
I uploaded this code only to allow peeking at the source code. It will not build on any other machine,
because it may require rewriting the whole source code, but it allows to view the code here - so that's why I uploaded it here.
